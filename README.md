The flower store project is my first assignment of attempting to create a single page website using React & Vite. Using tailwind and react, I learnt the first steps to make components to create a store front page for flowers.


How to run the project,

1. Once downloading the files you need to open it with VSCODE
    -Note: the Node modules are compact so removing them is better for installing them quicker
2. Since the node modules are not included, with the file open in terminal, you have to use the command cd (title_name) to get into the folder with all the working files and do npm install
    -Note: Make sure to sure you are in the working folder, with using the command ls in terminal to have display the files/folders

3. After that you can do npm run dev on the terminal and you can press the localhost link to see the updated React 


Challenges:

Some of the challenges were importing images for me, but after attempting a bit and learning from the in class quiz I figured you have to go back with ./

Installing tailwind, the process with the css was understandable with the changing the css because I looked at the import tailwind page, but I would forget about changing the tailwind config js file

Another thing with tailwind is that I didn't know how to style using it because I am new with it, but I found a cheatsheet that helped out

Working in react, sometimes a small thing would break the entire code or make my screen white, like different sections of code is conflicting

Importing in React, there is so many importing!!!!!!
